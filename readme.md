# ZJUNIX-SoC

A simple System-on-Chip built on an FPGA, originally targeted at Zhejiang University's SWORD4 FPGA experiment platform. It is designed to support simple operating systems developed by students; the first operating system running on this SoC is [ZJUNIX](https://github.com/ZJUNIX/ZJUNIX).

Detailed documentation is currently in progress; a general description is provided in doc/SoC.md.

# Creating the project

Follow these steps to create the SoC project from this repository:

1. Launch Vivado and open the TCL console.
   Note: This project is based on Vivado version 2016.2. Different versions of Vivado will produce different synthesis results, and it is possible for the design to fail to meet timing requirements.

2. Navigate to the ```project``` directory with the ```cd``` command.
   Note: The path to this directory should not contain spaces or non-ascii characters

3. Run the following TCL commands (substitute \<platform\>  with the target platform; currently N4DDR and SWORD4 are supported).

   ```tcl
   set project_platform <platform>
   source SoC.tcl
   ```

# Updating file set

The script ```fileset.tcl``` contains lists of design sources for different platforms. ```rtl_common``` and ```header_common``` record shared RTL sources and verilog headers, respectively. ```rtl_<platform>``` and ```constr_<platform>``` record RTL sources(including IP cores) and constraints for \<platform\>. ```constr_<platform>_target``` specifies the target constraint file for \<platform\>. When adding/removing source files to/from the project, these variables should be modified accordingly.
